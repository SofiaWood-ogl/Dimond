EXTRACT THE FILES TO A FOLDER
RUN THE PROGRAM

How to play:

To guess a letter, type in only one letter. (C) (A) (T)

To guess a word in full, type in more than 1 letter. (CAT)

Wrong guesses result in a life being subtracted. When you run out of lives you lose!

Correct guesses will result in the letters filling in the correct spots on the blank.
If all the blanks are filled, the word is shown and you win!

If you correctly guess a word in full, you win!

Each win grants you a point, each loss removes a point.
